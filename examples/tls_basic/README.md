# TLS Basic Sample application

(See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.)

This example connects to the broker `mqtt.eclipse.org` using ssl transport and as a demonstration subscribes/unsubscribes and send a message on certain topic.
(Please note that the public broker is maintained by the community so may not be always available, for details please see this [disclaimer](https://iot.eclipse.org/getting-started/#sandboxes))

It uses FreeRTOS coreMQTT library which implements mqtt client to connect to mqtt broker.

## How to use example

### Hardware Required

This example can be executed on any ESP32 board, the only required interface is WiFi and connection to internet.

### Configure the project

* Open the project configuration menu (`idf.py menuconfig`)
* Configure Wi-Fi or Ethernet under "Example Connection Configuration" menu. See "Establishing Wi-Fi or Ethernet Connection" section in [examples/protocols/README.md](../../README.md) for more details.
* When using Make build system, set `Default serial port` under `Serial flasher config`.

PEM certificate for this example could be extracted from an openssl `s_client` command connecting to mqtt.eclipse.org.
In case a host operating system has `openssl` and `sed` packages installed, one could execute the following command to download and save the root certificate to a file (Note for Windows users: Both Linux like environment or Windows native packages may be used).
```
echo "" | openssl s_client -showcerts -connect mqtt.eclipse.org:8883 | sed -n "1,/Root/d; /BEGIN/,/END/p" | openssl x509 -outform PEM >mqtt_eclipse_org.pem
```
Please note that this is not a general command for downloading a root certificate for an arbitrary host;
this command works with mqtt.eclipse.org as the site provides root certificate in the chain, which then could be extracted
with text operation.

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
